A discord bot designed for one server at once (private bot). Rewritten in
TypeScript using Deno. The predecessor variant of this can be found in
[another repository](https://github.com/raluvy95/maffin)

You can contribute whatever you want to improve the bot with additional features
and fixed bugs.

# Build a bot and self-host

All you need is to have latest version of [git](https://git-scm.com/) and
[deno](https://deno.land/) installed in your system<br> **Step 1**: Clone this
repostory `git clone https://github.com/raluvy95/jolly.git`<br> **Step 2**:
Rename `config-temp.json` to `config.json` and complete there.<br> **Step 3**:
Open in a terminal<br> **Step 4**: Run your bot with `deno task run`

# Advantages of Jolly over Maffin

- Jolly is rewritten in TypeScript which takes seriously when it comes to
  runtime error. So no more unexpected crash and no more TypeError in random
  cases.
- No more insane breaking changes from Discord API library
- Have own command handler, embed, utils and more
- With Deno, there's no node_modules folder either.
